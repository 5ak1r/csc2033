1. Roles and responsibilities during the SE phases (20)
- Only required to discuss SE phases that were expected to be experienced during the module (e.g. not maintenance)

- Belbin Team Roles (Plant/Specialist), talk about these a bit
- Few teammates that felt most comfortable with UI/UX design; pretty much left them to it, giving input when asked with minimal
contribution otherwise
- Gave idea for app name and potential icon however

- Waterfall Methodology
    - Requirements: 
        - Interaction with a database, containerised or externally hosted: Docker with a MySQL DB
        - Some form of access control: Admin access to the DB, user can only see and edit their own information
        - Front-End and Back-End: Assigned people halves to work on based on their strengths and weaknesses, entirely focused on one part
    - Design:
        - Technical Document, talk about parts of the document I worked on and parts I did not (talk about why perhaps)
        - UI/UX design, didn't really do much myself but made clear what technical functionality should be and which parts are more important for visibility purposes (should a button be bigger than another for example)
    - Implementation:
        - Best part for me, strengths lie in programming and making what has been assigned of me, very similar to other projects that we have done in the past
        - Making requirements was a bit difficult so following the list we made was more comforting
    - Testing:
        - Report due before code deadline, so code isn't completely done yet
        - Talk about how testing will be done
        - Testing plan as visible on Canvas, table of things to test, expected outcomes, etc.
        - Unit tests for the android app and potentially the unity game, need to do more research on how to conduct these tests
        - CI/CD tests for the AndroidStudio project; so far just have the requirement that it has to successfully build; cannot push broken files that do not compile - has done a fantastic job at keeping the app runnable at all times
    - Maintenance: Not Required

2. Skills developed and improved during the project (15)

- First time using Unity, C# and AndroidStudio
- First time using CI/CD and writing YAML files
- Working with Java again, improving my Java skills
- Massive improvement to knowledge of git and GitHub - using git fetch, git checkout, branching and git pull for the first time
- This section will mostly be about Unity and C#

3. Problems encountered and how you attempted to solve those problems (15)

- Group was mostly people with preference for front-end, think we split the work out quite well considering
    - Personal preference for back-end, so I had a lot of work to do and had a lot of fun during it
- Miscommunications with meetings at times; thinking there was a meeting when there wasn't; already had assigned work and did not
necessarily need to meet anyway, so this did not cause any hindrances
- Miscommunications with the game specifically; put a lot of planning time into the main app and not much about the game so there wasn't much of a concrete plan going into it
    - Gave me a lot of freedom with it
    - Another member of the group was working on movement for the playable character whereas I had already decided to implement a moving camera instead
        - Decided to keep the camera idea and potentially allow the character to move a little bit to backtrack while the camera is moving, similar to some other games
        - Not a mandatory feature of the game so there is a chance we won't implement it at all; low priority
    - Work on parallax background was also iffy, as their code was based off a moving sprite and mine was off a moving camera, so their work also ended up not being used
        - Keeping files in the folders as proof of work, but in actual implementation it would be removed
- Not much intercommunication between app half of group and game half
    - Not really needed but it would be nice; but there isn't much to say
- Tested functionality of exporting a Unity game into android studio at the start and had a lot of trouble with it. Got it working eventually and now know how to do it
    - Writing this with code incomplete, so it is unknown how successful it will be with our actual completed game and their completed app
        - Was testing it with a dummy game and default tutorial app layout


4. How has this module improved your employability skills and portfolio of work (15)

- Shows the ability to design a piece of software
- Ability to work well in a team, divide work between members in a way that satisfies everyone
- Ability to learn multiple new software on demand; choose the best software possible for each project with the confidence of knowing I have the capability to learn how to use it to make the product as best as possible
- Improved git and GitHub knowledge, know how to branch and work on software as part of a big team - huge employment skill
- Portfolio now includes an app made from scratch as well as a video game also made from the ground up; huge

5. What would you do differently in the future (15)

- Work more on both halves of the project; app and game not just one
- Work more on front-end; good to develop weaker skills
- Plan every part of the app as much as possible before starting; we thought the game would be a small endeavour but there was a lot more time and resources put into it than initial expectations
- Ask more potential users of the app for their opinions; more intricate, tailored planning
    - Asked a couple and got a lot of good ideas from them but more market research is always better

6. Form (5)

- References not required but can be included if desired
- References and Timesheet do not contribute to word count
